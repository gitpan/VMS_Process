This module lets you fetch a list of processes running on the cluster,
suspend, resume, and kill processes, get information ($GETJPI stuff) for
processes, and change prcesses priorities.

perl Makefile.pl
mms
mms test

to build and test the extension. If it tests OK, then

mms install

to install it. More info is in the POD documentation in the Process.PM file.

This module can't violate VMS system security in any way that DCL can't, so
if you don't have privs to see something, you can't. This will result in a
more restricted list of PIDs unless you've got privs--SHOW SYSTEM shows
pids that we can't always get to.

There's a sample script, show_sys_clone.pl, that more or less duplicates
the output of SHOW SYSTEM.
